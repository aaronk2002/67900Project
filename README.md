# 67900Project
The Fall 2022 Machine Learning Project by Aaron, Nguyen, and Rohan

To use the model, you must first download the required files from the following links
1. https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon_v2/categoryFilesSmall/Digital_Music_5.json.gz
2. http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Amazon_Instant_Video_5.json.gz
3. https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
For that last one, choose the twitter dataset.

The baseline_model.ipynb, dagger_model.ipynb, and loss_model.ipynb can be run once you download those required files.
As for the GloVe files, you need to run glove_twitter.ipynb, then glove_embeding.ipynb, and once finished you can run the last two files in any order.
